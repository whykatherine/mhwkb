Mental Health and Wellness Knowledge Base

The links in the [Knowlede Base](Knowledge_Base) are viewable. The goal
is to create a web site that displays them. Right now, people are encouraged
to [add their favorite mental health links](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Disclaimer
The content on the web sites linked to from the knowledge base has been
written by doctors, consumers, and a wide variety of people who have had
no formal education in the medical, psychological, or psychiatric field.
Among other things, the information on this site and external web sites and
blogs consists of opinions or personal stories - and as such, treated like any

## Warning About Discontinuing Medication
Please note: doctors recommend that no one should attempt to withdrawal
from psychiatric drugs (Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, Anti-anxiety drugs
and ADHD drugs) without a doctor's supervision. If you have firmly decided to
discontinue medication without a doctor's supervision, you may find some guides
to medication on Amazon or other book-selling sites.

## About Me
I first received treatment for mental health issues (major depression, anxiety,
PTSD) in 1991 (age 18). As a patient, I have seen numerous psychiatrists and
psychotherapists, and have been prescribed (and used) many types of psychiatric
medication. I have read many opinions on the subject of mental health, and the
negative and positive experiences consumers have had while using the mental
health care system. I have also read information written by journalists and
doctors. I have no formal education in biology, medicine, psychiatry, or
psychology.
